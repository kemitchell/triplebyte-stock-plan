Country-Specific Addendum

This Addendum includes additional country-specific notices, disclaimers, and/or terms and conditions that apply to individuals who are working or residing in the countries listed below and that may be material to Optionee’s participation in the Plan.  Such notices, disclaimers, and/or terms and conditions may also apply, as from the date of grant, if the Optionee moves to or otherwise is or becomes subject to the Applicable Laws or Company policies of the country listed.  However, because foreign exchange regulations and other local laws are subject to frequent change, Optionee is advised to seek advice from his or her own personal legal and tax advisor prior to accepting or exercising an Option or holding or selling Shares acquired under the Plan.  The Company is not providing any tax, legal or financial advice, nor is the Company making any recommendations regarding Optionee’s acceptance of the Option or participation in the Plan.  Unless otherwise noted below, capitalized terms shall have the same meaning assigned to them under the Plan, the Notice of Stock Option Grant and the Stock Option Agreement. This Addendum forms part of the Stock Option Agreement and should be read in conjunction with the Stock Option Agreement and the Plan. 

Securities Law Notice: Unless otherwise noted, neither the Company nor the Shares are registered with any local stock exchange or under the control of any local securities regulator outside the United States.  The Stock Option Agreement (of which this Addendum is a part), the Notice of Stock Option Grant, the Plan, and any other communications or materials that you may receive regarding participation in the Plan do not constitute advertising or an offering of securities outside the United States, and the issuance of securities described in any Plan-related documents is not intended for public offering or circulation in your jurisdiction.
