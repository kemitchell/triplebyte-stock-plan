EXERCISE AGREEMENT
This Exercise Agreement (this “Agreement”) is made as of _______________, by and between [Company Name], a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), and ____________________ (“Purchaser”).  To the extent any capitalized terms used in this Agreement are not defined, they shall have the meaning ascribed to them in the Company’s [YEAR] Stock Plan (the “Plan”) and the Option Agreement (as defined below).
14. Exercise of Option.  Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, Purchaser hereby elects to exercise his or her option to purchase _____________ shares of the Common Stock (the “Shares”) of the Company under and pursuant to the Plan, the Notice of Stock Option Grant and the Stock Option Agreement granted __________ (the “Option Agreement”).  The purchase price for the Shares shall be USD $__________ per Share for a total purchase price of USD $___________.  The term “Shares” refers to the purchased Shares and all securities received in connection with the Shares pursuant to stock dividends or splits, all securities received in replacement of the Shares in a recapitalization, merger, reorganization, exchange or the like, and all new, substituted or additional securities or other property to which Purchaser is entitled by reason of Purchaser’s ownership of the Shares.
15. Time and Place of Exercise.  The purchase and sale of the Shares under this Agreement shall occur at the principal office of the Company simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the payment of the aggregate exercise price by any method listed in Section 4 of the Option Agreement, and the satisfaction of any applicable tax, withholding, required deductions or other payments, all in accordance with the provisions of Section 3(b) of the Option Agreement.  The Company shall issue the Shares to Purchaser by entering such Shares in Purchaser’s name as of such date in the books and records of the Company or, if applicable, a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company, against payment of the exercise price therefor by Purchaser.  The Company will deliver to Purchaser a stock certificate or, upon request in the case of uncertificated securities, a notice of issuance, for the Shares as soon as practicable following such date.
16. Limitations on Transfer.  Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the Shares purchased under this Agreement are subject to (i) the transfer restrictions set forth in Section 12 of the Plan, (ii) the terms and conditions that apply to the Company’s Common Stock, as set forth in the Company’s Bylaws, [including (without limitation) certain transfer restrictions set forth in Section [__] of the Company’s Bylaws,] as may be in effect at the time of any proposed transfer (the “Bylaw Provisions”), and (iii) any other limitation or restriction on transfer created by Applicable Laws.  Purchaser shall not assign, encumber or dispose of any interest in the Shares except to the extent permitted by, and in compliance with, Section 12 of the Plan, the Bylaw Provisions, Applicable Laws, and the provisions below.
(a) Transfer Restrictions; Right of First Refusal.  Before any Shares held by Purchaser or any transferee of Purchaser (either being sometimes referred to herein as the “Holder”) may be sold or otherwise transferred (including transfer by gift or operation of law), the Company shall first, to the extent the Company’s approval is required by the Plan or any applicable Bylaw Provisions, have the right to approve such sale or transfer, in full or in part, and shall then have the right to purchase all or any part of the Shares proposed to be sold or transferred, in each case, in its sole and absolute discretion (the “Right of First Refusal”).  If the Holder would like to sell or transfer any Shares, the Holder must provide the Company or its assignee(s) with a Notice (as defined below) requesting approval to sell or transfer the Shares and offering the Company or its assignee(s) a Right of First Refusal on the same terms and conditions set forth in this Section 3(a).  The Company may either (1) exercise its Right of First Refusal in full or in part and purchase such Shares pursuant to this Section 3(a), (2) decline to exercise its Right of First Refusal in full or in part and permit the transfer of such Shares to the Proposed Transferee (as defined below) in full or in part or (3) decline to exercise its Right of First Refusal in full or in part and, to the extent the Company’s approval is required by the Plan or any applicable Bylaw Provisions, decline the request to sell or transfer the Shares in full or in part. 
(i) Notice of Proposed Transfer.  The Holder of the Shares shall deliver to the Company a written notice (the “Notice”) stating:  (A) the Holder’s intention to sell or otherwise transfer such Shares; (B) the name of each proposed purchaser or other transferee (“Proposed Transferee”); (C) the number of Shares to be sold or transferred to each Proposed Transferee; (D) the terms and conditions of each proposed sale or transfer, including (without limitation) the purchase price for such Shares (the “Purchase Price”); and (E) the Holder’s offer to the Company or its assignee(s) to purchase the Shares at the Purchase Price and upon the same terms (or terms that are no less favorable to the Company).
(ii) Exercise of Right of First Refusal.  At any time within 30 days after receipt of the Notice, the Company and/or its assignee(s) shall deliver a written notice to the Holder indicating whether the Company and/or its assignee(s) elect to permit or reject the proposed sale or transfer, in full or in part, and/or elect to accept or decline the offer to purchase any or all of the Shares proposed to be sold or transferred to any one or more of the Proposed Transferees, at the Purchase Price, provided that if the Purchase Price consists of no legal consideration (as, for example, in the case of a transfer by gift), the purchase price will be the fair market value of the Shares as determined in good faith by the Company.  If the Purchase Price includes consideration other than cash, the cash equivalent value of the non-cash consideration shall be determined by the Company in good faith.
(iii) Payment.  Payment of the Purchase Price shall be made, at the election of the Company or its assignee(s), in cash (by check), by cancellation of all or a portion of any outstanding indebtedness, or by any combination thereof within 60 days after receipt of the Notice or in the manner and at the times set forth in the Notice.
(iv) Holder’s Right to Transfer.  If any of the Shares proposed in the Notice to be sold or transferred to a given Proposed Transferee are both (A) not purchased by the Company and/or its assignee(s) as provided in this Section 3(a) and (B) approved by the Company to be sold or transferred, then the Holder may sell or otherwise transfer any such Shares to the applicable Proposed Transferee at the Purchase Price or at a higher price, provided that such sale or other transfer is consummated within 120 days after the date of the Notice; provided that any such sale or other transfer is also effected in accordance with the Bylaw Provisions, the transfer restrictions set forth in the Plan and any Applicable Laws and the Proposed Transferee agrees in writing that the Plan, the Bylaw Provisions, and the provisions of the Option Agreement and this Agreement, including this Section 3 and the waiver of statutory information rights in Section 8, shall continue to apply to the Shares in the hands of such Proposed Transferee.  The Company, in consultation with its legal counsel, may require the Holder to provide an opinion of counsel evidencing compliance with Applicable Laws.  If the Shares described in the Notice are not transferred to the Proposed Transferee within such period, or if the Holder proposes to change the price or other terms to make them more favorable to the Proposed Transferee, a new Notice shall be given to the Company, and the Company and/or its assignees shall again have the right to approve such transfer and be offered the Right of First Refusal.
(v) Exception for Certain Family Transfers.  Anything to the contrary contained in this Section 3(a) notwithstanding, the transfer of any or all of the Shares during Holder’s lifetime or on Holder’s death by will or intestacy to Holder’s Immediate Family or a trust for the benefit of Holder’s Immediate Family shall be exempt from the provisions of this Section 3(a).  “Immediate Family” as used herein shall mean lineal descendant or antecedent, spouse (or spouse’s antecedents), father, mother, brother or sister (or their descendants), stepchild (or their antecedents or descendants), aunt or uncle (or their antecedents or descendants), brother-in-law or sister-in-law (or their antecedents or descendants) and shall include adoptive relationships, or any person sharing Holder’s household (other than a tenant or an employee).  In such case, the transferee or other recipient shall receive and hold the Shares so transferred subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Bylaw Provisions, and the provisions of the Option Agreement and this Agreement, including this Section 3 and Section 8, and there shall be no further transfer of such Shares except in accordance with the terms of this Section 3, the Plan and the Bylaw Provisions.
(b) Company’s Right to Purchase upon Involuntary Transfer.  In the event of any transfer by operation of law or other involuntary transfer (including death or divorce, but excluding a transfer to Immediate Family as set forth in Section 3(a)(v) above) of all or a portion of the Shares by the record holder thereof, the Company shall have an option to purchase any or all of the Shares transferred at the Fair Market Value of the Shares on the date of transfer (as determined by the Company in its sole discretion).  Upon such a transfer, the Holder shall promptly notify the Secretary of the Company of such transfer.  The right to purchase such Shares shall be provided to the Company for a period of 30 days following receipt by the Company of written notice from the Holder.
(c) Assignment.  The right of the Company to purchase any part of the Shares may be assigned in whole or in part to any holder or holders of capital stock of the Company or other persons or organizations.
(d) Restrictions Binding on Transferees.  All transferees of Shares or any interest therein will receive and hold such Shares or interest subject to the Plan, the Bylaw Provisions, and the provisions of the Option Agreement and this Agreement, including, without limitation, Section 7 of the Option Agreement, Sections 3 and 8 of this Agreement and Section 12 of the Plan.  Any sale or transfer of the Shares shall be void unless the provisions of this Agreement are satisfied.
(e) Termination of Rights.  The transfer restrictions set forth in Section 3(a) above and Section 12 of the Plan, the Right of First Refusal granted the Company by Section 3(a) above and the right to repurchase the Shares in the event of an involuntary transfer granted the Company by Section 3(b) above shall terminate upon  the first sale of Common Stock of the Company to the general public pursuant to a registration statement filed with and declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act (other than a registration statement relating solely to the issuance of Common Stock pursuant to a business combination or an employee incentive or benefit plan) or  any transfer or conversion of Shares made pursuant to a statutory merger or statutory consolidation of the Company with or into another corporation or corporations if the common stock of the surviving corporation or any direct or indirect parent corporation thereof is registered under the Exchange Act.  Upon termination of such transfer restrictions, the Company will remove any stop-transfer notices referred to in Section 6(b) below and related to the restrictions in this Section 3 and a new stock certificate or, in the case of uncertificated securities, notice of issuance, for the Shares not repurchased shall be issued, on request, without the legend referred to in Section 6(a)(ii) below and delivered to Holder.
(f) Lock-Up Agreement.  The lock-up provisions set forth in Section 7 of the Option Agreement shall apply to the Shares issued upon exercise of the Option hereunder and Purchaser reaffirms Purchaser’s obligations set forth therein.
17. Investment and Taxation Representations.  In connection with the purchase of the Shares, Purchaser represents to the Company the following:
(a) Purchaser is aware of the Company’s business affairs and financial condition and has acquired sufficient information about the Company to reach an informed and knowledgeable decision to acquire the Shares.  Purchaser is purchasing the Shares for investment for Purchaser’s own account only and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any “distribution” thereof within the meaning of the Securities Act or under any applicable provision of state law.  Purchaser does not have any present intention to transfer the Shares to any other person or entity.
(b) Purchaser understands that the Shares have not been registered under the Securities Act by reason of a specific exemption therefrom, which exemption depends upon, among other things, the bona fide nature of Purchaser’s investment intent as expressed herein.
(c) Purchaser further acknowledges and understands that the securities must be held indefinitely unless they are subsequently registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from such registration is available.  Purchaser further acknowledges and understands that the Company is under no obligation to register the securities.
(d) Purchaser is familiar with the provisions of Rule 144, promulgated under the Securities Act, which, in substance, permits limited public resale of “restricted securities” acquired, directly or indirectly, from the issuer of the securities (or from an affiliate of such issuer), in a non-public offering subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions.  Purchaser understands that the Company provides no assurances as to whether he or she will be able to resell any or all of the Shares pursuant to Rule 144, which rule requires, among other things, that the Company be subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, that resales of securities take place only after the holder of the Shares has held the Shares for certain specified time periods, and under certain circumstances, that resales of securities be limited in volume and take place only pursuant to brokered transactions.  Notwithstanding this Section 4(d), Purchaser acknowledges and agrees to the restrictions set forth in Section 4(e) below.
(e) Purchaser further understands that in the event all of the applicable requirements of Rule 144 are not satisfied, registration under the Securities Act, compliance with Regulation A, or some other registration exemption will be required; and that, notwithstanding the fact that Rule 144 is not exclusive, the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission has expressed its opinion that persons proposing to sell private placement securities other than in a registered offering and otherwise than pursuant to Rule 144 will have a substantial burden of proof in establishing that an exemption from registration is available for such offers or sales, and that such persons and their respective brokers who participate in such transactions do so at their own risk.
(f) Purchaser represents that Purchaser is not subject to any of the “Bad Actor” disqualifications described in Rule 506(d)(1)(i) to (viii) under the Securities Act.  Purchaser also agrees to notify the Company if Purchaser becomes subject to such disqualifications after the date hereof.
(g) Purchaser understands that Purchaser may suffer adverse tax consequences as a result of Purchaser’s purchase or disposition of the Shares.  Purchaser represents that Purchaser has consulted any tax consultants Purchaser deems advisable in connection with the purchase or disposition of the Shares and that Purchaser is not relying on the Company for any tax advice.
18. Voting Provisions.  As a condition precedent to entering into this Agreement, at the request of the Company, Purchaser shall become a party to any voting agreement to which the Company is a party at the time of Purchaser’s execution and delivery of this Agreement, as such voting agreement may be thereafter amended from time to time (the “Voting Agreement”), by executing an adoption agreement or counterpart signature page agreeing to be bound by and subject to the terms of the Voting Agreement and to vote the Shares in the capacity of a “Common Holder” and a “Stockholder,” as such terms may be defined in the Voting Agreement.
19. Restrictive Legends and Stop-Transfer Orders.
(a) Legends.  Any stock certificate or, in the case of uncertificated securities, any notice of issuance, for the Shares shall bear the following legends (as well as any legends required by the Company or applicable state and federal corporate and securities laws):
(i) “THE SECURITIES REFERENCED HEREIN HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AND HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED FOR INVESTMENT AND NOT WITH A VIEW TO, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THE SALE OR DISTRIBUTION THEREOF.  NO SUCH SALE OR DISTRIBUTION MAY BE EFFECTED WITHOUT AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT RELATED THERETO OR AN OPINION OF COUNSEL IN A FORM SATISFACTORY TO THE COMPANY THAT SUCH REGISTRATION IS NOT REQUIRED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933.”
(ii) “THE SECURITIES referenced herein MAY BE TRANSFERRED ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE Company AND THE stockholder, A COPY OF WHICH IS ON FILE WITH AND MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE SECRETARY OF THE Company at no charge.”
(iii) “THE TRANSFER OF THE SECURITIES referenced herein IS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS SET FORTH IN [THE COMPANY’S BYLAWS (AS AMENDED FROM TIME TO TIME) AND] THE COMPANY’S STOCK PLAN, COPIES OF WHICH MAY BE OBTAINED UPON WRITTEN REQUEST TO THE COMPANY AT ITS PRINCIPAL PLACE OF BUSINESS.  THE COMPANY SHALL NOT REGISTER OR OTHERWISE RECOGNIZE OR GIVE EFFECT TO ANY PURPORTED TRANSFER OF SECURITIES THAT DOES NOT COMPLY WITH SUCH TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS.”
(iv) Any legend required by the Voting Agreement, as applicable.
(b) Stop-Transfer Notices.  Purchaser agrees that, in order to ensure compliance with the restrictions referred to herein, the Company may issue appropriate “stop transfer” instructions to its transfer agent, if any, and that, if the Company transfers its own securities, it may make appropriate notations to the same effect in its own records.
(c) Refusal to Transfer.  The Company shall not be required (i) to transfer on its books any Shares that have been sold or otherwise transferred in violation of any of the provisions of this Agreement or the Plan or (ii) to treat as owner of such Shares or to accord the right to vote or pay dividends to any purchaser or other transferee to whom such Shares shall have been so transferred.
(d) Required Notices.  Purchaser acknowledges that the Shares are issued and shall be held subject to all the provisions of this Section 6, the Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws of the Company and any amendments thereto, copies of which are on file at the principal office of the Company.  A statement of all of the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions granted to or imposed upon the respective classes and/or series of shares of stock of the Company and upon the holders thereof may be obtained by any stockholder upon request and without charge, at the principal office of the Company, and the Company will furnish any stockholder, upon request and without charge, a copy of such statement.  Purchaser acknowledges that the provisions of this Section 6 shall constitute the notices required by Sections 151(f) and 202(a) of the Delaware General Corporation Law and the Purchaser hereby expressly waives the requirement of Section 151(f) of the Delaware General Corporation Law that it receive the written notice provided for in Sections 151(f) and 202(a) of the Delaware General Corporation Law within a reasonable time after the issuance of the Shares.
20. No Employment Rights.  Nothing in this Agreement shall affect in any manner whatsoever the right or power of the Company, or a parent, subsidiary or affiliate of the Company, to terminate Purchaser’s employment or consulting relationship, for any reason, with or without cause.
21. Waiver of Statutory Information Rights.  Purchaser acknowledges and understands that, but for the waiver made herein, Purchaser would be entitled, upon written demand under oath stating the purpose thereof, to inspect for any proper purpose, and to make copies and extracts from, the Company’s stock ledger, a list of its stockholders, and its other books and records, and the books and records of subsidiaries of the Company, if any, under the circumstances and in the manner provided in Section 220 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (any and all such rights, and any and all such other rights of Purchaser as may be provided for in Section 220, the “Inspection Rights”).  In light of the foregoing, until the first sale of Common Stock of the Company to the general public pursuant to a registration statement filed with and declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Purchaser hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives the Inspection Rights, whether such Inspection Rights would be exercised or pursued directly or indirectly pursuant to Section 220 or otherwise, and covenants and agrees never to directly or indirectly commence, voluntarily aid in any way, prosecute, assign, transfer, or cause to be commenced any claim, action, cause of action, or other proceeding to pursue or exercise the Inspection Rights.  The foregoing waiver applies to the Inspection Rights of Purchaser in Purchaser’s capacity as a stockholder and shall not affect any rights of a director, in his or her capacity as such, under Section 220.  The foregoing waiver shall not apply to any contractual inspection rights of Purchaser under any written agreement with the Company.
